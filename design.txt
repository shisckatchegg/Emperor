define UI space on screen:
	-conversations with vassals next to  vassal/player
	-minimal UI on top showing ABSTRACT resources: respect and...
	-every other resource must be shown by calling the appropriate vassal/player
	
vassals:
	Main way to interact with the world: interface
	
	Types:
		Chief Guard: security, default protects, imprisons, executes, scouts, arranges armies.
		Butler: taxes, resources, budget, family state.
		Priest: perform ceremony religion/respect, omens? 
		Messenger: communicates to other towns
		Architect: builds things
	Left click: talk
	Right click: appoint normal noble to position / demote position holder
	Keyboard button: shout, no need to talk to specific vassal, shortcut (maybe can be edited personally: so that a player can assign an action to a certain button and if certain vassal is available perform it)
	
Resources:
	Respect
	This resources can belong to the state or to the player, if they belong to the player, increase respect, personal guard?.
	State: keep vassals and landed vassals happy, redistribution. Raise armies, build infrastructure.
